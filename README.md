# My Python Projects

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Philip Vu and this is my repository of my Python projects. I start this repository on 7/18/2020 and I hope to create many more scripts to automate my busy life. Additionally, I hope to eventually sharpen my Python skills with these scripts. If you are visiting then you can look over at the scripts and check out my work. If you have any tips and trick you would like to share, don't be afraid to message me.

**Thank you!**
